Welcome to PyNet's documentation!
===================================

**PyNet** is a Python library for building your very own computer networks from
the ground up.  It uses the details of the `Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model>`_ to simulate the behavior of
the various media, hardware and software that make up a network, allowing users
to simulate actions such as file transfers or even network attacks.
